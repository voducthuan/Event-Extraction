Event Realtion Extraction based on Event Networks

Event relations specify how different event flows expressed within the context of a textual passage relate to each other in terms of temporal and causal sequences. We propose an unsupervised event network representation for temporal and causal relation extraction that operates at the document level. We benefit from existing Open IE systems to generate a set of triple relations that are then used to build an event network. The event network is bootstrapped by labeling the temporal disposition of events that are directly linked to each other. We systematically traverse the event network to identify the temporal and causal relations between indirectly connected events.
